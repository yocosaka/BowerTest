# BowerTest

The goal here is to demonstrate your expertise in Rails by building a small app which has a range of skills required. This should take you longer than 20 hours. You may spend 20 hours across 10 days to work on this, we donâ€™t want you to overwork yourself while having a full-time job.

**Task:** Build a rails app that allows a user to login and upload an image that gets automatically tagged using an external image API service called Clarifai.
  
Here is the layout you may use as reference: [BowerTest Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/IWL90EwwbVkQrK2IBUePfm/BowerTest?node-id=2%3A42)

Here's a quick introduction Loom of what we are looking for from BowerTest. 
Ps: If you're not a video person, there's a lengthy boring text after this ðŸ˜œ

**Some key notes**

-   Weâ€™ll provide a github repository for you to use as a starting point.This includes Rails 6, and Bootstrap 5. You may fork this repository and create a Pull Request upon completion.
-   Use Devise for the authentication.
-   Use [Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/?did=ft_card&trk=ft_card) for the storage. Youâ€™ll need to create a free account.
-   Use [Clarifai](https://www.clarifai.com/) for the Image tagging. Youâ€™ll need to create a free account.
-   Create a responsive layout based on desktop wireframe
-   Provide basic CRUD for the images and tags
