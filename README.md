## About the Project

This project was built with Ruby on Rails that allows a user to login and upload an image that gets automatically tagged using an external image API service called Clarifai.

The base of this application was provided by [Lim Choon Yun (Marco)](https://github.com/marco8757) at Bower Bird as a starting point which includes Rails 6, and Bootstrap 5.

**Some keynotes**

- Implement Devise as an authentication system
- Use [Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/?did=ft_card&trk=ft_card) for the storage
- Use an external API, [Clarifai](https://www.clarifai.com/) for the Image tagging
- Use [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/getting-started/introduction/) to create a responsive layout based on the provided [desktop wireframe](https://www.figma.com/file/IWL90EwwbVkQrK2IBUePfm/BowerTest?node-id=2%3A42) design
- Provide basic CRUD for the images and tags
- Add tests with Rspec, shoulda matchers
